The grey circle is odd and the grey square is even. Digits along the blue line must be between the values at each end of that line. Digits along an arrow sum to the value in the associated circle. (The two-digit pill should be read as a two-digit number from left to right for these purposes.) Digits in a cage do not repeat; if a value is given for the cage, the digits sum to that value. Digits along a thermometer must increase from the bulb end. The orange cell is greater than the four digits orthogonally adjacent to it. Two cells separated by a black dot must have a 1:2 ratio. Digits along the marked brown diagonal may not repeat.</div><a href="https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/LNqP9d8tdj" class="link" target=”_blank”>Link to Puzzle</a><img src="images/puzzle-4.png" class="puzzle-img center"></div>
