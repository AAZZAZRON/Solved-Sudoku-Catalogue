Every cage must be entirely shaded or unshaded, and every row and column contains at least one shaded cell. In each row and column the cell that contains the number of shaded cells in that row/column is indicated either by a square or a circle. Circles indicate that all shaded cells in that row/column are orthogonally connected; squares indicate those shaded cells are not all orthogonally connected (though some may be).
